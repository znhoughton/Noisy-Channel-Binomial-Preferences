\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

In order to examine the effects of noisy-channel processing on the
reading times of binomials, we used a primed self-paced reading task
with a mental rotation task. Specifically, participants were first
presented auditorily with a prime sentence while simultaneously
completing a mental rotation task. The mental rotation task involved
determining whether one was a simple rotation or a mirror image of
another image. The rotation was always wither 0 degrees or 45 degrees.
Participants were tasked with either pressing the `f' key or the `j' key
(counter balanced between participants) to indicate that the image was
either a simple rotation or a mirror image. The idea behind the mental
rotation task was that by forcing participants to multi-task they may
rely more on noisy-channel processing than when they can focus solely on
the prime sentences.

After listening to the prime sentence and completing the mental
rotation, participants then completed a self-paced reading task.
Specifically, participants were presented with a sentence word-by-word
and pressed the `space' key when they were ready to proceed to the next
word. Reaction times for the time it took participants to press the
`space' key were recorded for each word. After each sentence,
participants were presented with a comprehension question to test their
attention. The comprehension questions were questions either about the
prime sentence or the sentence they had just read.

\subsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}

Our stimuli consisted of 30 polarized binomials.\footnote{Our stimuli
  and analyses are available at the following link:
  \url{https://github.com/znhoughton/Noisy-Channel-Binomial-Preferences}.
  The stimuli are also included in the appendix section
  (Section~\ref{sec-full-list-of-stimuli}).} Specifically, these were
binomials that occurred more than 400,000 times (out of 323,592,921,465
tokens), calculated using the Google \emph{n}-grams corpus
(\citeproc{ref-michel2011quantitativeanalysisculture}{Michel et al.,
2011}). Additionally, they all had a relative frequency of either less
than -0.30 and greater than 0.30. Relative frequency indicates which
ordering is more preferred (and to what magnitude). For example, a
binomial that occurs equally as many times in both orders would have a
relative frequency of zero (where relative frequency ranges from -0.50
to 0.50). A relative frequency value below 0 indicates that the
nonalphabetical ordering occurred more than the alphabetical ordering in
corpus data, and a number above zero indicates the opposite. The
magnitude of the number indicates the strength, with 0.50 indicating
that the binomial occurred exclusively in alphabetical ordering and
-0.50 indicated the binomial occurred exclusively in nonalphabetical
ordering.

For each of these binomials, we created a prime and a target sentence
containing the binomial in either order. Specifically, for each
binomial, three prime sentences were made: one that contained the
binomial in the frequent ordering (e.g., \emph{bread and butter}), one
that contained the infrequent ordering, (\emph{butter and bread}), and
one that did not contain a binomial at all. These priming conditions are
referred to as the frequent, infrequent, and unrelated primes
respectively. We also made two target sentences (the sentences read
during the self-paced reading task) for each binomial. The target
sentences contained the binomial in either the frequent or infrequent
ordering. Finally, we also included 30 filler trials, which did not
contain binomials in the prime or target sentences.

Our prime and target sentences were crossed such that each target
occurred with each prime, however no participant was presented with the
same binomial in more than one trial.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

228 University of California, Davis undergraduate students were given
course credit to participate in the study. We also recruited an
additional 220 participants through Prolific. Altogether, 448 people
participated in our study.

Participants were randomly presented with one of 6 conditions. Since our
design is a 3 x 2 design, 6 conditions were created so that participants
did not encounter the same binomial in more than one trial.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{analysis}

We divided the sentences into a target and spillover region to be our
region of analysis. This region included the 3 words in the binomial
along with the 3 following words. We then excluded participants whose
reading times on this region were less than 100ms or greater than 5000
ms (following \citeproc{ref-morganAbstractKnowledgeDirect2016}{Morgan \&
Levy, 2016}). We also excluded participants who had an average accuracy
below 0.7 on the audio comprehension questions (the questions that asked
about the auditorily presented prime). Finally, we excluded trials for
which the residual reading times were outside of 2.5 standard deviations
from the mean.

We then ran two Bayesian mixed-effects regression models with residual
reading times as the dependent variable.\footnote{A pre-registration of
  our study is available at the following link:
  \url{https://aspredicted.org/t324-swgk.pdf}.}

For the first model, we were interested in whether a frequent prime
affected the residual reading times. As such, we filtered the dataframe
to include trials that contained either an unrelated or frequent prime.
We then treatment coded our variables such that for the prime sentences,
0 indicated an unrelated prime and 1 indicated a frequent prime. For
target sentences, 0 indicated an infrequent target while 1 indicated a
frequent target. We then ran a model with residual reading time as the
dependent variable, fixed-effects for prime, target, and their
interaction, as well as maximal random-effects (following
\citeproc{ref-barrRandomEffectsStructure2013}{Barr et al., 2013}).

Our second model was similar, however we were interested in how the
infrequent prime affected residual reading times. As such, we filtered
our dataframe to include trials that contained either the unrelated or
infrequent prime. We then treatment coded our variables such that 0
indicated an unrelated prime and 1 indicated an infrequent prime.

Our model syntax was the same for both models, as mentioned previously
the difference was the levels of the variables included in the data.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-models}{
\begin{aligned}
\text{Residual Reading Time} & \sim \text{Intercept} + \text{prime freq} * \text{target freq} \\ 
&+ (\text{prime freq} * \text{target freq} | \text{Item}) + (\text{prime freq} * \text{target freq} | \text{participant})
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

\section{Results}\label{results}

We first examined whether a frequent prime facilitated the reading of
the frequent ordering of the binomial more than the reading time of the
infrequent ordering. Following Houghton et al.
(\citeproc{ref-houghtonTaskdependentConsequencesDisfluency2024}{2024}),
in addition to reporting the estimates we also report the percentage of
posterior samples greater than zero. Bayesian statistics don't force us
into a binary interpretation of significance or non-significance, by
reporting the percentage of posterior samples greater than zero we are
able to interpret the results in a more nuanced manner.

The results are presented in Table~\ref{tbl-frequentresults} and
visualized in Figure~\ref{fig-fullresults}. Since prime and target types
were treatment coded, the Intercept represents the estimated reading
times for unrelated prime sentences with an infrequent target sentence.
Coefficient estimates represent the distance from the Intercept.
Although the credible interval crosses zero, over 93\% of the posterior
samples for the effect of frequent prime were greater than zero,
suggesting that for not-frequent targets, the frequent prime resulted in
slower reading times than the unrelated prime. Similarly, over 93\% of
the posterior samples for frequent target were less than zero,
suggesting that for unrelated primes, the frequent target was read
faster. Finally, about 90\% of the samples for the interaction effect
were less than zero, suggesting that the difference between the reading
times in the unrelated prime condition and the reading times in the
frequent prime condition were larger for infrequent targets than
frequent targets. In other words, the frequent prime speeds up the
reading times for the frequent ordering of the binomial more than the
infrequent ordering of the binomial.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\endgroup{}

}

\end{table}%

Next we examined whether the infrequent prime speeds up the infrequent
ordering of the binomial more than the frequent ordering. If readers are
engaged in noisy-channel processing when listening to the prime, they
may actually activate \emph{bread and butter} when they hear
\emph{butter and bread}. This would result in the infrequent prime
speeding up the \emph{frequent} ordering of the binomial more than the
infrequent ordering.

The results are presented in Table~\ref{tbl-infrequentresults} and
visualized in Figure~\ref{fig-fullresults}. Similar to the previous
model, since prime and target types were treatment coded, the Intercept
represents the estimated reading times for unrelated prime sentences
with an infrequent target sentence. Coefficient estimates represent the
distance from the Intercept. We find no meaningful main-effect for
infrequent primes or frequent targets, but we do find a meaningful
interaction effect. While the credible interval crosses zero, over 90\%
of the posterior samples were greater than zero. The results suggest
that the infrequent prime speeds up reading for the infrequent target
more than the frequent target.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our results demonstrate that both the frequent and infrequent ordering
of a given binomial speeds up the reading times of the respective
ordering. That is, priming the frequent ordering speeds up the reading
of the frequent ordering, and priming the infrequent ordering speeds up
the reading of the infrequent ordering.
